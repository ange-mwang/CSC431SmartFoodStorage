# CSC431SmartFoodStorage

  Smart Food Storage app designed for University of Miami CSC431 (Softwre Engineering) Spring 2022. This app is in its pre-alpha stgae. 
  
  # What is *Smart Food Storage?* 
  
  The Smart Food Storage app allows users to view recipes based on the food items they have currently stored in their *Smart Food Fridge*. The *Smart Food Fridge* will automatically detect what item and its quantity the user currently has in their fridge. Based on this information, the *Smart Food Storage* app will generate recipes in a simple yet efficient format. Users can also manually input information if needed. 
The recipes generated are solely based on what food items are in the users fridge, allowing users to easily create culinary concoctions without having to worry about missing ingredients. If there is only one or two missing ingredients, the app will suggest popular substitution ingredients (also based on the user's food items.) Users can also 'favorite' and rate recipes through the app.
